# 🗃️ Repo: One-Time Scripts & Notes

**⚠️ Disclaimer! ⚠️**

This repository is **NOT** 🙅‍♀️ your typical daily development grind. It's more like a collection of one-off scripts 📜 and notes 📝 that I refer back to occasionally.

**Think of it like this:**

*   **Single-use scripts:** ⚡️ These scripts are designed to run *once* and that's it. They serve a specific, often temporary purpose.
*   **Memory jogger:** 🧠  I use this repo to store information or steps 👣 I might need to revisit later.
*   **No real implementation here:** 🙈 You won't find any polished, production-ready code here. It's mostly rough drafts and quick solutions.
*   **Constantly evolving (in a messy way):** 🔀 I often edit ✏️ these scripts directly to meet my current needs, so don't expect consistency or best practices.

**In short:**

This repo is my personal 🧰 toolbox for quick tasks and a place to dump 📥 useful tidbits of information. It's not intended for collaboration 👥 or as a model of proper coding style.

**Use at your own risk!** 😉
